What is HTTP?
    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is an application protocol used for communication between web servers and clients (such as web browsers). It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.

    When a user types a URL into a web browser, a request is sent to the server using HTTP. The server then responds with the requested resource, such as a web page or an image.

What is a Communication Protocol?
    A communication protocol is a set of rules and standards that enable two or more entities to exchange information or data. Communication protocols specify the format, timing, sequencing, and error checking of messages that are exchanged between the entities.

Do humans use communication protocols?
    Yes, humans also use communication protocols in many different contexts. In human communication, protocols can be seen as sets of rules and conventions that guide how people communicate with each other in different situations.

What is a Request in HTTP?
    In HTTP, a request is a message sent by a client (such as a web browser) to a server, requesting some action or resource. The request typically contains a set of headers that provide additional information about the request, such as the method used for the request, the resource being requested, and the type of data that the client can accept.

What is a Response in HTTP?
    In HTTP, a response is a message sent by a server to a client (such as a web browser) in response to a request. The response contains the requested resource or information about the action that was taken, such as whether it was successful or not.

What is an HTTP method?
    In HTTP, a method is a type of request that a client (such as a web browser) can make to a server to perform an action on a resource. The HTTP protocol defines several standard methods, also known as HTTP verbs, that clients can use to interact with servers. The most commonly used HTTP methods are:
    GET: retrieves a resource from the server. The server returns a representation of the resource in the response message body.
    POST: submits data to the server to create or update a resource. The data is included in the request message body.
    PUT: updates an existing resource on the server with new data. The data is included in the request message body.
    DELETE: deletes a resource from the server.
    HEAD: retrieves the headers for a resource without the message body.
    OPTIONS: retrieves information about the communication options available for a resource.
    TRACE: echoes back the received request message as a way to test and debug communication.

What are HTTP request headers?
    HTTP request headers are additional pieces of information that a client (such as a web browser) can send to a server along with an HTTP request. These headers provide additional context and instructions to the server about how to handle the request.
