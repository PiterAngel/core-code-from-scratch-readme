What is JSON?
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text format that is language-independent and uses a simple syntax to represent data in a structured way.

Is JSON the same as a plain Javascript object?
    A plain JavaScript object is a data structure that is used to store and organize data in JavaScript. It consists of a collection of key/value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be any data type, including other objects, arrays, functions, and primitive values like strings, numbers, and booleans.

What is REST?
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that defines a set of principles for building web services. RESTful web services are built on top of the HTTP protocol, and use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources or data on a server.

Is REST a programming language, framework, technology, or architecture pattern?
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style, not a programming language, framework, or technology. It is a set of design principles for building web services that are based on the HTTP protocol and other web standards.
    REST is a simple and lightweight approach to building web services, and it has become a popular choice for designing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that can be consumed by a wide range of clients, from web browsers to mobile devices to other web services.

What is a Resource in REST?
    In REST (Representational State Transfer), a resource is a concept or entity that is identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and can be manipulated or accessed using the standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others.
    A resource can be anything that can be represented in a web-based system, such as an article, a user profile, a product catalog, or a database record. Each resource is identified by a unique URI, which can be used to access or manipulate the resource using the appropriate HTTP methods.

What is a resource identifier?
    A resource identifier is a unique identifier that is used to identify and locate a specific resource in a web-based system. In the context of REST (Representational State Transfer), a resource identifier is typically a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that uniquely identifies a resource.

How are HTTP and REST related?
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) are closely related, as RESTful web services are built on top of the HTTP protocol.

What HTTP methods does REST use within its architecture rules?
    REST (Representational State Transfer) defines a set of architectural constraints and principles for building web services, and it uses HTTP methods to interact with resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

Why do we use HTTP methods in REST and how do they relate to resources?
    HTTP methods are used in REST to perform operations on resources. In a RESTful web service, resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and HTTP methods are used to interact with those resources.

Is REST the same as HTTP?
    HTTP is a communication protocol that is used to transfer data between web clients (such as web browsers or mobile devices) and web servers. It defines a set of standard methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others) that are used to interact with resources or data on a server.
